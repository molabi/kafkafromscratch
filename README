Included here are the slides that will be used for the tutorial, in three
formats:
	* Powerpoint (PPTX)
	* PDF Color
	* PDF Grayscale (Handout - 2 slides per page)

In addition, there are two scripts that are used in the tutorial:
	* python-producer.py
	* python-consumer.py

As a bonus, there are two items which are not really part of the tutorial,
but which you should find useful:
	* kafka_ch02.pdf
	  This is a VERY early draft of a book chapter on how to install
	  Kafka, as well as hardware selection, tuning, configuration, and
	  production concerns

	* kafka-assigner.py
	  This is a script, written at LinkedIn, which can be used for managing
	  partition balance in a Kafka cluster, beyond what the basic Kafka
	  tools can do. This includes easily adding and removing brokers from
	  a cluster, as well as rebalancing partitions across a cluster.
